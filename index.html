                        challenge – even if you may not recognise it as such! </p>
                    <p class="lead">We’ve categorised what we believe are the most common wellness challenges below.
                        Some of them may overlap with each other. Ultimately, we want you to OWN your wellness
                        challenges and work towards maintaining ‘good wellness.’</p>
                    <p class="lead">Hopefully the categories below will help you recognise what challenges you may be
                        experiencing and subsequent articles from our ambassadors, as well as future trainings, will
                        empower you to work through your own wellness challenges.</p>

                    <p class="feature-text">As we’ve evolved, so have our imaginations. Sometimes our minds cant’t
                        distinguish between what’s objectively real or not and this can cause all kinds of challenges
                        for us, such as anxiety and depression. You Own It is here to empower you to take control over your mind once
                        again so that you can live a happy and fulfilled life.</p>

                    <p class="feature-text">We can sometimes feel like our bodies are a ‘battlefield’ and we know deep
                        inside that we ought to maintain a healthy body. You Own It is here to empower you to take
                        control and make small changes in your life so that you can start to feel healthier but also to
                        enjoy your journey towards becoming healthier.</p>

                    <p class="feature-text">Sometimes, we can be surrounded by all sorts of people but we still can feel
                        lonely. We find it easier to conform rather than following our own intuition and taking our own
                        paths. You Own It is here to give you the confidence to go out there to find ‘your crowd.’ We
                        will help you transform into the social butterfly you’re meant to be!</p>

                        every day! It could be argued that knowing how to own your Everyday Wellness challenges is the
                        most important strategy you can take away from this website, as once you feel empowered to do
                        so, the other wellness challenges may seem easier for you to work through.</p>
